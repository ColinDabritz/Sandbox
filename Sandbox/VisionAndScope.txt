D&D GMs
D&D Game Designers
Developers

Vision:

D&D "Combat takes too long"
"An electronic character sheet"

Helping D&D players enjoy playing D&D sessions by automating the character sheet and the more complex formulas to enable more fluid and responsive gameplay.

(Note: GM may use this for NPCs and Opponents, but we are only supporting character like abilities, not general monster support)

Scope:
Entering Character Stat Information (NOT creating or rolling characters)
Loading/Saving of Characters to Disk (not networked/cloud etc)
Equiped Items Manager (No inventory manager)
Class bonus information
Player Chosen Temporary Statuses (e.g. Power Attack)
PvE Temporary Statuses (e.g. Flat Footed)
Tracking of character statuses (e.g. HP, ToHit, AC, Damage )
Melee and Ranged Combat Support (NOT Magic yet)
Not networked (yet)
No dice yet (but an eye toward adding them later)

Tracked modifiers will default reasonably and automatically, but be overrideable by the player

Character Has:
HP
Attack
Damage
Armor Class

Using the above we will calculate:
Current Attack Bonus (per attack)
Current AC
Current HP total
Current Damage (per attack)

For these values 
We will give final numbers for the above

Maybe Later:
More of a DM tool
Networked?
Further automation
